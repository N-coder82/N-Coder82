### Hi there! 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: making a reminders app called [Chi](https://github.com/N-coder82/chi) in Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, GUI design in Python, and how to use ffmpeg, homebrew, and CLI Git
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: The C# compiler was first written in C and C++, but was then updated to be compiled in C#, the very langauge it compiles! ✨
