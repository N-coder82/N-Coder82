### Hi there! 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: making a git based backup utility called [Gitback](https://github.com/N-coder82/gitback) in Bash.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Bash, zsh, and how to distribute CLI apps.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: Swift was developed for 4 years in secrecy, nobody knew about it outside of Apple, which is impressive.
- 😍 Current Obession: [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one)
