### Hi there! 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: making simple, useful shell scripts such as [diskspeed](https://github.com/n-coder82/diskspeed), and [ghuser](https://github.com/n-coder82/ghuser) in Bash.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Bash, C/C++ (haven't decided which), and how to distribute CLI apps.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: Python has its own zen philosophy![^1]
- 😍 Current Obession: [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one)
